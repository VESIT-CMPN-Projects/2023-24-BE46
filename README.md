**Agromender: Plant Disease and Pest Detection Project**
**Overview**
Agromender is a project aimed at helping farmers detect and identify plant diseases and pests early, allowing for timely intervention and improved crop yield. The project uses machine learning models to analyze images of plants and provide accurate diagnosis, along with suggestions for treatment.
**Components**
* 		ML Models: Developed ML models using Python and libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for disease and pest detection.
* 		Web UI: Created a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the ML models and display results.
* 		Deployment: Deployed the web application using Colab files for accessibility.
**Technologies Used**
* Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Colab (for model development and deployment)
**Features**
* Image Upload: Users can upload images of affected plants for analysis.
* Disease Identification: ML models analyze uploaded images to identify diseases or pests.
* Treatment Suggestions: Provide recommendations for treating identified diseases or pests.
* User Interface: Intuitive web interface for easy interaction and understanding of results.

**Conclusion**
Agromender aims to revolutionize plant disease and pest detection, providing farmers with a valuable tool for improving crop health and yield. The project demonstrates the power of machine learning and web technologies in agriculture, paving the way for smarter farming practices.
